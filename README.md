# First-Principles-Neural-Network

## Overview
This repository contains a neural network model built from scratch, demonstrating the fundamental principles of neural network architecture and optimization. The specific model implemented is called a "two brain hemisphere" neural network, where the input is processed through two separate hemispheres (north and south) before being combined in the last hidden layer.

## Model Architecture
Two Brain Hemisphere Model:
North Hemisphere: The categorical input data is processed through this hemisphere.
South Hemisphere: The continuous input data is processed through this hemisphere.
Combination Layer: The outputs of the north and south hemispheres are combined in the last hidden layer.
Hidden Layers: The model consists of two hidden layers.

## Features
Built from Scratch: The architecture is constructed from first principles, demonstrating the core components of a neural network.
Forward Pass: Implementation of the forward pass to propagate input data through the network.
Optimization: Parameters are optimized using Newton's method with regularization (NLG).
Prediction and Visualization: The model predicts data and plots response curves to visualize performance.

## Project Structure
Architecture Construction: Code for building the neural network architecture from scratch.
Forward Pass: Implementation of the forward pass mechanism.
Optimization: Scripts for parameter optimization using NLG with regularization.
Prediction and Visualization: Code for predicting data and plotting response curves.
